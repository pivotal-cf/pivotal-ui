As defined by [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#visual-audio-contrast-contrast), the conformance levels measured here are AA and AAA. AAA is a higher standard to meet than AA. Since large text is easier to read than smaller text, the contrast standards are lower for larger text.

- **Level AA (large text) compliance**: For large text, contrast ratio should be at least **3:1**.
- **Level AA compliance**: For regular-sized text, contrast ratio should be at least **4.5:1**.
- **Level AAA (large text) compliance**: For large text, contrast ratio should be at least **4.5:1**.
- **Level AAA compliance**: For regular-sized text, contrast ratio should be at least **7:1**.

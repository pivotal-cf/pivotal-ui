We encourage and appreciate all contributions, large and small, from the Pivotal community. Our code and documentation is open-source and located in the [Pivotal UI GitHub repo](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pivotal-ui). If you're interested in getting involved, here are some ways you can help.

## Filing an issue

Found a typo in our documentation? Encountered a bug in one of our components? Have a feature request? Please [file an issue](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pivotal-ui/issues/new) to let us know about it! This is the quickest and easiest way to help out.

If you're comfortable making the change yourself, please read on for guidelines.

## Submitting a pull request

To submit a pull request, we recommend forking the Pivotal UI repo. Make your changes to your fork and then submit a PR to bring the changes back to the main repo.

If you already have push access to the main repo, you can also create a branch and submit a PR from there.

For large pull requests, especially those that involve breaking changes, it's a good idea to reach out to the maintainers as early as possible to help us understand the change you'd like to make. This will make the process much easier for all involved.

## Improving components and styles

Pivotal UI components and styles live in the [`src` directory](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pivotal-ui/tree/master/src).

If your team has built a component that you feel would be a good fit for Pivotal UI (i.e. it could be useful to several Pivotal teams), let the maintainers know via an issue or on Slack so we can figure out the best way to help.

## Writing documentation

Text content & code examples are written in Markdown files located in the [`docs` directory](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pivotal-ui/tree/master/docs). Smaller changes to these files can be made directly on GitHub. Each page on this site also has a link to edit it on GitHub.

The style guide itself is a React app built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Source files live in the [`styleguide` directory](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pivotal-ui/tree/master/styleguide).

## Getting in touch

If you have questions or suggestions, or if you just want to chat about Pivotal UI, either file an issue or reach out to the maintainers on our Slack channel ([#pivotal-ui](https://pivotal.slack.com/messages/C055JEPQQ)).

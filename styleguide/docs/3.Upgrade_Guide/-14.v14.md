## Goals

The goals of the 14.0 release are:

- Remove dependency on Bootstrap from all PUI components
- Remove all Bootstrap files from PUI

## The Big Changes

### Code component

All CSS from Bootstrap that styled `code`, `kbd`, `pre`, and `samp` elements has been moved to `pivotal-ui/css/code`. If these tags are no longer styled as expected, add `import 'pivotal-ui/css/code'` alongside your other CSS.

### Grids component

This component was based on Bootstrap Grids, and has been removed. Use our Flex Grids component and/or CSS classes instead. Here are some examples of the changes required to migrate from the older, Bootstrap-based component:

#### React

Deprecated Bootstrap-based Grid:

```jsx harmony
//nonInteractive
<Row>
  <Col md={8}>...</Col>
  <Col md={16}>...</Col>
</Row>;
```

FlexGrid:

```jsx harmony
<Grid>
  <FlexCol>...</FlexCol>
  <FlexCol grow={2}>...</FlexCol>
</Grid>;
```

#### CSS-only

Deprecated Bootstrap-based Grid:

```html
//nonInteractive
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8">...</div>
  <div class="col-md-16">...</div>
</div>
```

FlexGrid:

```html
//nonInteractive
<div class="grid">
  <div class="col">...</div>
  <div class="col col-grow-2">...</div>
</div>
```

### Other Bootstrap CSS/utility classes

Any Bootstrap CSS that was not a part of any PUI component, but which was included by PUI, will no longer work. Install Bootstrap CSS separately if needed.

### Removed

The following components were deprecated several releases ago, and are no longer documented. They have now been removed:
- Bootstrap Grids component (`pivotal-ui/react/grids` and `pivotal-ui/css/grids`)
- Google Maps component (`pivotal-ui/css/google-maps`)
- Avatars component (`pivotal-ui/css/avatars`)

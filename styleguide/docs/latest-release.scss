- Introduce a [Flex driven grid system](#link to the css doc for the grid system) and a CSS table based on this system.

### Buttons

All buttons require the `.btn` class at a minimum to receive PUI styling.

### Dropdowns

- `pullRight` property replaced by `menuAlign` property to give explicit control over dropdown menu alignment.
- The toggle option has been removed.
- Users can no longer replace the dropdown icon with any element. It has been replaced by the icon option which takes a string specifying the name of the iconography icon that should be used by the dropdown.
- The menuCaret option has been replaced by the `showIcon` for clarity as setting `menuCaret` to `true` or `false` actually set the visibility of the icon prior to PUI 8.

### Forms

Inline checkboxes, radio buttons and labels have been removed. Unstyled inputs have also been removed.

### Iconography

The .svgicon, .svg-baseline and .svg-middle classes have been replaced by the .icon, .icon-baseline and .icon-middle classes respectively

### Tables

Data, key-value, striped, and light table styles have been removed. Variable sized scrollable tables have been removed. Scrollable tables are now all one size.

### Buttons

The buttons all have updated styles, and there are fewer of them.

- `DefaultAltButton` is removed. Use `DefaultButton` instead. You may want to set the `alt` prop to true. If you still want the shadows, use [box shadows](/css_utilities_box-shadows.html)
- `LowlightButton` is removed. It can be approximated with `DefaultButton` with `flat` set to true
- `HighlightButton` is renamed to `PrimaryButton`
- `HighlightAltButton` is removed, just use `PrimaryButton`. Marketing sites may want to use `BrandButton`. Web apps are discouraged from using `BrandButton`.


### Dropdowns

There are no longer 7 dropdown components (`LinkDropdown`, `DefaultDropdown`, `HighlightDropdown`, etc). There is only `Dropdown`.
The `Dropdown` component takes many React props. To recreate the old `LinkDropdown`, you can use `Dropdown` with `flat` and `link` props set to true.
Most of the other old dropdown styles have been removed. There are basically only three launcher styles now: default, flat, and split.

### React Iconography

- Use the `src` prop instead of the `name` prop
- The `Icon` component will inline SVGs instead of using Font Awesome. Many of the icons may have different names and different layout properties.
- Webpack svg-react-loader is now required for iconography. If you are using pui-react-tools, you will need to `npm install` the webpack loaders and upgrade pui-react-tools to version ^2.0.0.
- Icons no longer take the `size` prop. Instead, they are sized at the local font size.
If you want an icon with a different size, you can change the font size around that icon. For example, if you set the font size to 24px, the SVG should be 24px wide and 24px tall.
You can also provide a `style` prop with `width` and `height` if that is more appropriate.

### CSS Iconography

If you are using iconography, but not using React, it will be more difficult to use. All of the SVGs are inside of the `pui-css-iconography` node module.
If you would like to use an icon, you can use the SVGs directly from the node module.
If you do not mind black icons, you can serve up the SVGs and use them inside of `img` tags.
If you need to color your icons, you need to copy the content of the SVG and put it directly into your html. CSS can then be used for colors.

### CSS Alerts

Alerts look the same, but the css has changed from float to flexbox. If you have a multi-line alert, you may need to add an extra div directly inside of your alert wrapping your old contents.
Also, the close button is no longer float: right, so it needs to be at the end of your alert html.

### General

There are more breaking changes than usual in this release, it is possible we missed something. Please file issues on github or ask questions on the pivotal-ui slack channel.

- Alert: The `dismissable` prop is now just a boolean. If you want a function that is called on dismissal, use the `onDimiss` prop.
- Modals: The `bsSize` prop has been renamed to `size`.
- React Bootstrap: Alerts, Grids, Modals and Tabs are now entirely different code paths. The goal was to replace all old functionality, but undocumented behavior may have changed.

### Typography

pui-react-typography is no longer supported.
Replace `<DefaultH2>`, `<AlternateH2>` or `<MarketingH2>` with `<h2>`.
The headers will now be less bold. This is intended by the designers.
If your application wants headers to be bigger and bolder, add CSS in your own application.

### Renames

- `<BasicInput>` becomes `<Input>`
- `<SearchInput>` becomes `<Input search>`
- `<SimpleTabs>` becomes `<Tabs>`
- `<SimpleTabsAlt>` becomes `<Tabs tabType="simple-alt">`
- `<SortableTable>` becomes `<Table>`
- `<OverlayTrigger trigger={['hover']}>` becomes `<OverlayTrigger trigger="hover">`
- Use `TileLayoutItem` instead of `TileLayout.Item`
- Look for `RadioGroup` in `pui-react-radio`

### Other changes

- Stop using the `fancy-select` CSS class, just use regular selects.
If you want a fancy chooser, consider dropdowns.
- Provide a class to Input with the `inputClassName` prop instead of `className`.
- DropdownItem no longer automatically wraps content in an `a` tag unless an `href` prop is provided.
- The markup generated by tooltips is different. The classes are prefixed with 'pui-', like 'pui-overlay'.

### CSS Compiling

We would like to deprecate Dr Frankenstyle due to its performance issues and maintenance cost.
In PUI 4.0, you can use Webpack loaders instead.
The combination of `css-loader`, `file-loader` and `extract-text-webpack-plugin`
recreates the functionality of Dr Frankenstyle in much less time.

See the [Webpack Config](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/react-starter/blob/master/config/webpack.config.js) in React Starter.
In React Starter `NODE_ENV=production gulp assets` will output a `components.css` file
in addition to any fonts and images needed by that CSS into `public`.
